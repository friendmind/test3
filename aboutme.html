            I hope you followed the instructions from the alert you got when clicking that next page button. If you did, 
            WELCOME. This is day 3 of this project. I mentioned there would be interactive elements 
            this time around and you have already seen and used some of them. You were already
            introduced to links in the previous website. Now, I have upped my game and you are using buttons. 
            But buttons are not the only interactive part of these pages. There are hidden interactive elements
            that cannot be accessed through your phone, you must use your computer. There were a total of 5 (including
            the navigation area and next page button) interactive elements on the
            previous page. If you have not found them all and would like to, try hovering around with your mouse and 
            see what you find. But before doing so, you can go ahead and browse this page.
        </p>
        <p class="all_par aboutme_par">
            Now, this is the page I was the least happy with. Most of what I had written was removed.
            Most of, if not all, that made it to the final version did not capture what I was trying
            say. I swayed from things and overshared. Which was expected, but none the less embarrasing.
            I will not be trying to get it right. I have said enough and this is a light-hearted
            project. Not a redo of the previous one. This section will be a focused interactive section. So don't worry, 
            there is no ranting here.

            <br><br>
            I've created a little game for you and I hope you have fun. So without further ado, enjoy the following:

           <strong>Instructions</strong>
           <br> You said you understand Spanish. I have no idea if you are good at reading Spanish
                but we're about to find out. I have meticously chosen some Spanish words that come 
                from a game called Loteria that I used to play a lot as a kid. You're job is to guess
                the right translation of each word in the table. I made this very simple. So I'm hoping 
                you do good. If you don't, I'mma be a bit disappointed not gonna lie &#128514;
