            We've made it. The last page. The best for last. Just kidding. What was your favorite page?
            If I were to guess based on visual style, I think it was the main page. Am I right?
            <br><br>
            It's crazy to think that each page took me a full day to draft out. Then another two days to
            edit and fix the whole website's content, look and responsiveness. Then another two days to just 
            let the project sit before sending it your way. The reason I sat on it was because I wanted to make sure
            I wasn't going to sent you something I would go on to regret. The last website took me 
            two days to draft and complete. Out of impulse, I sent it a little too early. I was excited
            for you to see the project that I forgotten why I had even created it in the first place. <span class="extra_tooltip" title=" As I am editing this, I can tell you that everything you have read, seen and interacted with I am happy with. There are no regrets in this one. Which is GREAT.">But you live and learn.</span> 
            <br><br>
            There was more to this website than the previous one. More to play with. More thought and creative
            aspects to it. This whole project was an educational experience for sure. But I also found it helped keep me entertained
            and productive. It ended up having a positive effect on me and I hope it had the same effect on you. That it 
            lightened or brightened your day even slightly.
        </p>
        <p class="all_par extra_par">
            If you have made it this far, I assume you have enjoyed or been intrigued by all this. Whatever
            it might be, I am glad you are here. 
            <br><br>
            So 
            this is an additional page I added. I wasn't sure what I was going to put here. Actually, I had no idea what 
            I was trying to go for with this website. I went on adding and removing as I went. Going based
            on what felt right and looked good to me. Each page was inspired by what I felt, thought and saw at 
            the given moment. So this section will not be any different. 
            <br><br>
            So with that, <em>Welcome to the Finale</em>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="extra_h2">I suppose I can give you an update</h2>
        <p class="all_par extra_par">
            A couple things have happened since the last time we've spoken. The main one being I got a hair
            cut. That might not be big news or anything but to me it is. As you know, I had wanted to cut my 
            hair. Actually, I don't even know if that is what I told you. I think I just said I didn't 
            trust my mom cutting my hair anymore. Anyways, I had told my sister, Edith, and our friend, Susan,
            if they would be down to go to the nail salon to get my hair cut. This nail salon is where they both
            get there nails done and where they happen to cut hair as well. Since it was a place that was familiar, 
            I considered going there to get a hair cut. I pitched we should go there soon but we never set a date to go. 
            Fast-forward a week later, my sister shows up unexpectedly
            and tells me if I am ready to go to the nail salon. I was caught off guard as by that time I had decided
            to grow out my hair. As you could imagine, I was struggling to make a decision. It was now or never my sister said. After
            a minute of deep thinking, I said fuck it and off we went. My older sister, Mariana, ended up tagging along
            as well. So we had the whole gang there: both of my sisters, Susan (our friend) and Nadia (Susan's daughter).
            <br><br> 
            I was nervous, of course, as I had not gotten my hair cut by someone other than my mom or away from home before. I 
            was scared that they would mess up the hair cut. But you know what, good or bad hair cut, I was going 
            for the experience. If I didn't like 
            the cut I'd just grow it out, no big deal right? Well, I took a seat on one of the fancy chairs they had and was
            met with a huge mirror in front of me. I'm glad I don't have perfect vision because seeing them cut my hair with perfect
            vision would have only made me even more nervous. 
            <br><br>
            I was fine for the first half of the hair cut. It 
            wasn't until she kept changing guards that I began to get nervous again. At some point, she took out an 
            electric razor that had a sharp blade and let me tell you she was going at it with it. She was doing things I have never experienced before when
            getting a hair cut so I was panicking a bit. But I told myself to trust the process. That she knows what she's 
            doing. Fast-forward to the end of the hair cut, I'm glad I trusted the process because I loved how it turned out.
            It did feel weird seeing myself with short hair again as I had gotten accustomed to the weight and look longer
            hair had given me. But for the first time, I actually got the hair cut I asked for &#128514; My friend was recording
            the experience so when I got up there she was with the camcorder getting the full look reveal. Everyone had a
            positive reaction to my hair cut which I was not expecting at all. Even the other worker there complemented me. She said it looked good and 
            that short hair suited me. I was flattered by her last comment as no one has ever told me that before. As you can expect, I will definitely be returning there if I want a new look.
            <br><br>
            As for the look, I really do look and feel different. Crazy what a hair cut can do to a person. Anyways, the only person who was 
            not happy with the look was my mom, which was expected. She has always preferred my hair long. But I did
            not mind her reaction. I am happy with my hair cut and that is what matters.

            to browse the website on any device you have. I tested a view devices to make sure everything

            I will be working on that with time. But with that <span class="extra_tooltip" title="I say goodbye. I hope you had fun. If you want to do the last section (the email section) go ahead. If you don't, that is okay.">
