            At this point, I am just using this as an excuse to play around and test out what I am learning
            from my classes. So don't mind me. As you know, I had a lot of fun making the last website. And 
            as you could expect, I had the brilliant idea of doing another one, but with some changes. 
            I found the last website lacked certain elements I had no idea how to achieve or could not achieve 
            despite trying. I felt it was missing some things which I am looking to include and fix this time around.
            I plan to implement the new things I have learned and hope I can do them properly.
            So you can see this as is an updated version of the last one. There will be bit of a change in the content and 
            the theme but it will contain some of the same main elements from the previous one. So here's to an 
            updated version of the last website. Or a new one entirely? I don't know. <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="We will in fact see how much my thought process changed&#128557;&#128514;">We'll see.</span>
        </p>
        <div class="all_par main_par">
        <p>
            I suppose some things you should consider before moving to the following pages:
            <br><br>
            <ol class="main_ul">
                <li>You should consider looking at the website through your computer.
                    You may get something a little different when browsing through it on your computer that
                    gets missed when browsing through it on your phone.
                </li>
                <li>There will be interactive elements on this one so be on the look out for them as they
                    may not be as direct as some of them.</li>
                <li>Don't worry about the content the following pages will have. It will not be like the previous
                    one. You can say I have learned my lesson &#128037;
                </li>
                <li>Lastly, 
                    <button  class="all_buttons"
                    onclick="alert('Have fun and enjoy it! I\'m just starting this but I am already happy with what I\'ve achieve on this page. You will see I will be leaving commentary as I create the website. I will be jumping from past tense (current me, working on the website) and present tense. I thought to give you a heads up in case things don\'t make sense at times or if there is a sudden change. \n\n Update: New Rule! Each page will be a different theme. Because of this you can only view one page per day. So come back tomorrow to view the following section: Thoughts. \n\nSorry about that!')">
                    click me</button>
                </li>
            </ol>
