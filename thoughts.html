            To start off, I just want to say I am not looking for you to reach out to me.</span>
            That is not the reason I am making this. You just happen to be the only person that has showed interest in this
            type of thing so it seemed right to send this to you. I mean this was made for you so not anyone can see it. 
            But still, if I didn't think you would enjoy this type of thing I would not have created this and sent it your way.

                With everything I have done and am doing I would not be shocked if you think I am crazy.
                I mean I am shocked at the speed I came in and messed things up. Like I broke my own record
                with this. That's not a good thing, though. 
                <br><br>
                I'm laughing at myself now, for how I handled the 
                situation. But don't worry I am fine now. I did lose it a bit but I needed that event for my character arc&#128514; 
                which I hate to say. I needed a reality check and I got it. I think you shouldn't have been the one to have
                to give it to me considering what you were going through. But it is what it is right?
                <br><br>
                You must think you've really lucked out with me. Like I'm sure you did
                not expect me to be like this at all. Or maybe you did. Maybe you had a hunch.
                <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="What am I even saying &#128514;"> Who knows.</span>
                <br><br>
                I have no idea what you think of me. And I okay with that. I wasn't before. My mind had a million
                thoughts before it quiet down. I have learned to not get caught up with not knowing certain details.
                But that doesn't matter. One way or another, I am sure you must be having or had some crazy thoughts 
                about me. <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="I had moments where I tried putting myself in your shoes. And every thought I had was not good.">
                And I don't blame you.</span>

                    My problem is I let my thoughts and feelings consume me too much. I get lost in these things and no one ever puts me in check
                    expect for myself. I mentioned I am self-aware of myself. I saw what I did and knew I messed up and I tried to 
                    make up for it. 
                    <br><br>
                    I had learned that sometimes trying and not leaving things as they are is not the only choice we have.
                    We have the opportunity to change things. To try and fix things. Things are not definitive unless we let them be.
                    It all comes down to acting. We don't need to sit around and ponder about things, about the what ifs when we can simply act
                    and see what happens. I mean the worst thing that can happen by trying is you're left with feeling embarrassed or whatever.
                <br><br>
                    Returning to the first statement above, I have found that someone's silence has always been a trigger for my mind. It causes it to go rampant.
                    And I had forgotten that was a thing for me. It leaves too much room for my mind to play
                    with me. To blur things. To believe things that are not true. But don't worry, we sometimes
                    need to experience these things to be able to challenge ourselves. How I said before, I am
                    fine. I've had a lot of back and forth with myself regarding certain things and I'm currently
                    feeling the best I've had in a while. <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="I hate that it really took this to reel me back into reality.">Which is crazy to say.</span> 
                    Honestly, there is always something to learn. At least, I always end up learning something from these types of things.
