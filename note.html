            After some back and forth, I finally
            figured out what to do here. From the last website, this page had focused on you. 
            I've decided that will not change. I will not be doing the exact same thing but
            the concept remains. Despite having that down, I still had no idea what to include here.
            In the beginning, nothing I included here seemed right.
            I tried doing a couple things but scrapped them. I was left with no clue of what to do, what to add and so on. 
            For a moment, I thought it was best to just scrap the whole page as I was coming empty handed. But I couldn't get
            myself to do that. It wasn't right. This was the most important section the previous time so I had to keep this in.
            
            <br><br>
            Why was this page so difficult you might be wondering.    
            <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="Dude I have no urge to do my homework. I should not be working on this when I have other responsibilities &#128557; My parents think I'm working on homework when I'm literally here doing this. I should probably take a break from this and actually focus on my school work. I just don't want to&#128553;">
            Well, I'm not sure if it's because I was tired or I had run out of ideas or because I couldn't just
            do what I wanted here. I had to be very specific.</span> What do I mean by that? This whole page is tailored to you. It is a YOU page after all.
            So I couldn't just do ANYTHING. After doing a bit of brainstorming and by luck, I landed on some ideas on what this page would contain. After hours of 
            working on this page this is what I came up with. <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="There are parts of me scattered in here too but they were included solely because I thought you would enjoy them.">So I hope you enjoy this page because it took me hours to finally get this right.</span>

            You're a big movie fanatic. I have honestly not met anyone that loves movies as much as you do. 
            We grew up watching a lot of the same movies but there are some that I have not watched that you 
            have mentioned. From the section above I have only watched two out of the four and only really liked 
            one of them. Can you guess which I one love with all my heart? 
            <br><br>
            I find it funny that you loved any movie that had
            a dog in it because now that I think about it I did too&#128557; I remember being obsessed with Oliver
            and Company. Did you ever watch Old Yeller or Hotel for Dogs or Homeward Bound? Classics. 
            <br><br>
            Returning to the topic at hand&#128514; I remember you said you LOVED Mulholland Drive. Well...I can't say the same&#128557;
            I was hooked the first half but then got lost at some point. Then the ending came and I was like ????? I think
            I need to watch it again because if you loved it that much clearly I should give it another shot. The Hunger Games, as you know,  
            I have not watched any of them. I've also never seen Kill Bill but it does looks awfully familiar. Not sure why 
            but the poster reminds me of the movie Scott Pilgrim. Did you ever watch that movie?
            <br><br>
            Now, the last movie left: Balto. I fricking love that movie so much that I drew something from it when
            I was a kid and is now a center piece in my room. If that is not enough to prove that I love that movie
            so much, 
            I have both the DVD and the VHS for it. You had asked me if I had a comfort movie the last time we hung out. 
            Well, Balto is definitely one of them.

            Music. You love music. You love consuming it and creating it. It is one of those things that 
            is important to you. So I could not make this page for you without there being a music section.
            I have chosen some songs which I will not be disclosing. There will be no give away of the name of the song or the artist.
            You will have to go through each one of them on your own to get those answers. I will say all these songs were on repeat as I was working
            on this page. So you can thank these songs for setting the tone here. There isn't much else I can say here so go ahead and give them a listen.
